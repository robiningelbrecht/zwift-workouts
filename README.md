This repository contains **three structured Zwift workouts** designed to be used together as a simple, repeatable training program.  
The focus is on **aerobic development (Zone 2)** with **targeted intensity**.

The plan works well for riders training **4 or 5 days per week**, where the **Zone 2 ride is repeated multiple times**.

---

## Included Workouts

### 1. Over Under Threshold (50min)
**Purpose:** Build sustainable power just below FTP  
**Intensity:** High Zone 3 / Low Zone 4 (90–120% FTP)

This workout targets the “comfortably hard” range. It improves:
- Lactate clearance
- Muscular endurance
- Ability to hold steady power for longer efforts

Best done when relatively fresh.

---

### 2. 30/30 VO₂max (1h)
**Purpose:** Improve aerobic ceiling and repeatability  
**Intensity:** Very high (120–130% FTP during work intervals)

Short, sharp efforts with brief recoveries. This workout:
- Pushes VO₂max
- Improves ability to handle surges
- Trains fast power recruitment

This is the hardest workout of the week, treat it with respect.

---

### 3. Long Zone 2 Ride (1h30)
**Purpose:** Aerobic base & endurance  
**Intensity:** Zone 2 (60–70% FTP)

This is the foundation of the program. Zone 2 work:
- Improves mitochondrial density
- Builds fatigue resistance
- Supports recovery between harder days

This workout is intentionally repeatable and should feel **easy enough to finish while still feeling good**.
